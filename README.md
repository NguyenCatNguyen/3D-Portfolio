<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

# 3D Porfolio
-  TechStack: `React.js`, `Three.js`, `TailwindCSS`, `React Three Fiber`.
- Build Tools: Vite.

#### Packages Installed
- `npm install react-three-fiber three`
- `npm install @react-three/drei`
- `npm install @react-three/fiber`
- Leva
  - `npm install leva`
-  


### Three.js Notes
1. Canvas
    - Canvas is the container for all the 3D objects.
    - Everything inside the Canvas is a 3D object.
```jsx
import { Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber';

return(
    <Canvas></Canvas>
)
```

### React Notes
##### UseState can also be use with Tenary Operator to display icons
```jsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
return(
    <div>
       <img src={isOpen ? "close.png" : "open.png" }/>
    </div>
)
```

- Use Tenary Operator right inside the className to add or remove classes.
```jsx
<div className={`nav-sidebar ${isOpen ? "max-h-screen" : "max-h-0"}`}>
</div>
```

###### Efficent way to create `NavList`
- Create NavItem component right on top of Nav component.
- Directly create a list of items inside the NavItem component.
```jsx
const NavItem = () => {
    return(
        <ul className='nal-ul'>
            {["Home", "About", "Project", "Contact"].map((item, index) => (
                <li key={index} className='nav-li'>
                    <a href="" className='nav-li_a'>{item}</a>
                </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    )
}

const Nav = () => {
    return(
        <nav className='nav'>
            <NavItem />
        </nav>
    )
}
```
